This is a Book Store Application built with React and Redux-Thunk. The application allows users to add new books to the server asynchronously and view a list of books from the server. The project was created as a part of an assignment to demonstrate my understanding of handling asynchronous requests with Redux-Thunk.

## Technologies Used

- React JS
- Redux-Thunk

## Features

- Add new books to the server asynchronously using a form on the right side.

- View a list of books from the server in the "Book List" section.

- Search books by name in the "Book List" section using the search bar in the navigation menu.

- Edit a book's information by clicking on the Edit icon of the card item and updating the information in the "Add New Book" form.

- Update a book by clicking the "Update Book" button in the form and resetting the form.

- Delete a book from the server by clicking the delete button.
